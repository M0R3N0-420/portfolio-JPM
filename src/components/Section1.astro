        I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator
        artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets
        tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me
        (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying
        fashionable.
